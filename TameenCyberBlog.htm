        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Tameen - Welcome to my Cyberspace Blog.</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 2022 University of Toronto bachelor degree graduate, 
specializing in Criminology and Sociology. I have recently decided
        to make a lateral career shift to Cybersecurity because I find 
this field interesting and have spent the majority of my life curious 
about and using        
computers, and have had a desire to learn about how Cyber professionals 
safeguard websites from malicious actors.
            <br><br>
            In this blog, I will write about some cybersecurity topics 
which I find interesting, that are also related to what I have learned 
about in my bootcamp.

                <h3>Is Zero-Trust Architecture the future of Cybersecurity?</h3>
                <h4>How viable is it? <br><br> keywords: Zero-trust, networks, data breaches</h4>
                <p>As the world becomes more technologically advanced, 
malicious actors are finding new ways to compromise sensitive data of 
organizations and costing them money. Recently, there has been a 358% 
increase of malware attacks from 2019 to 2020 (Griffiths, 2023), and  on
 average, data breaches cost businesses $4.35 million (Griffiths, 2023).
 This highlights the importance of being able to disrupt such attacks 
and potentially save millions of dollars for businesses annually. 
A framework that has been garnering more attention is Zero-Trust 
Architecture (ZTA). The ZTA framework fundamentally requires real-time 
visibility and active monitoring of users accessing, or attempting to 
access the network.
<br><br>
	In theory, implementing ZTA will significantly reduce data breaches, 
since at least 80% of all cyber attacks involve credentials use (Raina, 
2023). With ZTA, users attempting to connect to a network would be 
required to provide and match authorized credentials, including geo 
location, firmware versions, and even more in-depth identity attributes 
such as behavioral patterns like typing speed (Ladstaetter, 2023). 
Therefore, this would minimize the likelihood of cyberattacks through 
credential misuse, since any mismatch would cease authorization. 
<br><br>
However, ZTA has some difficulties for businesses to implement. Probably
 the most significant struggle is being able to accurately identify 
organizational workflow so that operations are not disrupted while 
implementing the framework (Qureshi, 2020).This would require constant 
oversight so that users are not disrupted by authentication issues. 
Implementing the ZTA would benefit from microsegmentation of the network
 (for example, based on departments) to preserve regular workflow. 
Unfortunately, this would probably lead to the implementation taking 
much longer, and therefore being more costly. 
<br><br>
Therefore, it is vital that cyberprofessionals looking to pitch ZTA to 
company executives, and perhaps request the hiring of a Chief Zero Trust
 Officer (CZTO), include a cost-benefit analysis of the money that is 
being saved from avoiding data breaches, 
in order to make the argument for a ZTA framework more convincing if it 
is necessary (Qureshi, 2020). Finally, there should be large 
considerations of how a ZTA framework would impact employees directly 
who have to interact with the network, as there would likely be 
frustrations and inconveniences with verifying a user account, 
particularly when trying to access the network on different devices - 
this makes the experience much less flexible for workers. Some 
businesses who operate on or utilize digital supply chains, such as 
third party vendors, may not be able to implement ZTA architecture, 
since verifying that many users would be inconvenient (Yaari, 2023).

                <h3>Securing a Home Network</h3>
                <h4> Home networks, encryption, security</h4>
                <p>
                   Internet and network access has become increasingly 
essential to everyday people, where in 2018-2019, 94% of Canadians had 
home internet access, with the majority of those who didn't citing cost 
and unavailability and reasons why they didnt(Statistics Canada 2019). 
Despite some major data breaches, including the ChatGPT breach that 
leaked personal data of users, as well as the  Western Digital Data 
Breach on April 3 that gave hackers access to numerous cloud systems, 
many owners of home networks feel that it is not as necessary to secure 
their home cybersecurity. However, a secure network would at the minimum
 prevent unwanted or freeloading users on the network, and in more 
serious contexts, may proect an individual's sensitive data related to 
credit card numbers or privileged credentials (Anders, 2023).

<br><br>
		However, users can improve and secure their home network with a number
 of simple steps. Firstly, changing the name of the default home network
 provides increased protection, since by default, most routers are named
 after the manufacturer and may even include a model number (Kapersky). 
Similarly, these routers also come with preset generic passwords that 
can be discovered online, and so changing the password to something else
 would be beneficial (Anders, 2023). It is recommended that the password
 be at least 12 characters long, incorporating special symbols and 
numbers for increased strength (Kapersky, 2023). <br><br>

Finally, enabling encryption on the wireless router, eiher to Wifi 
Protected Access 2 (WPA 2) or WPA 3 (the number signifying different 
versions. Enabling WPA 2 for example ensures that only the user's device
 and the router can read what is being transmitted (Kaspersky, 2023). 
While there are additional security measures for reinforcing a home 
network, these are the ones I find to be the most important and 
necessary for basic and admissible home network security.
